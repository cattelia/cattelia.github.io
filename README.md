### You earn the life you want and it doesn't come free.

#### My Wage - _Jessie R. Rittenhouse_

> “I bargained with Life for a penny,
> and Life would pay no more,
> However I begged at evening
> When I counted my scanty store;
>
> Life is a just employer.
> He gives you what you ask,
> But once you have set the wages,
> Why, you must bear the task.
>
> I worked for a menial's hire,
> Only to learn, dismayed,
> That any wage I had asked of Life,
> Life would have willingly paid.”
